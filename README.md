# Keplerian Dynamics Examples

This is a repository containing three [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks that are **automatically converted to HTML** by a github action, and published to github pages.

They explore a range of different calculations:
1) Assignment_p1.jl: Solution of Keplers Equation, Classical Orbital Elements to rv state function, Ephemeris function.
2) Assignment_2.1.jl: Two-body dynamics orbit propagation.
3) Assignment_2.2.jl: RV state vector to Classical Orbital Elements function, other frame conversion functions, maneuver calculations.
